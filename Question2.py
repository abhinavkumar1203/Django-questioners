# Yes, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller by default which means when a signal is sent,
# the signal handler executes within the same thread as the code that triggered the signal.

#Explaination by a simple code snippet : 

import threading #Module to interact with and retrieve information about threads
from django.db.models.signals import post_save #Signal triggered after a model instance is saved
from django.dispatch import receiver #connect signal handlers to signals
from django.contrib.auth.models import #User Import built-in User model


@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def user_post_save_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    #As the funcion is connected to the post_save signal of the User model it is automatically executed after a User instance is saved.
    print(f"Signal handler thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")
    # Prints the thread name where this function is executed
    # Explaining --> By default, the signal handler runs in the same thread as the caller.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"Caller thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")

    user = User(username="test_user")
    
    # Execute the signal handler (user_post_save_handler) in the same thread
     user.save()
